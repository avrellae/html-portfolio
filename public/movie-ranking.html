<h1> Best Movies According to Ella </h1>
<h2> Animated of course, dur </h2>
<hr />
<h3>SHREK</h3>
<p> An animated movie about a scottish ogre? With a talking donkey who makes love with a dragon? Best one this world has seen. It's 3d and I'm not really a fan of this medium, but this one passes. </p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p> I mean have you seen the beautiful and powerful warlock named Howl? This movie brings so much comfort and joy to me as a young adult. In fact, all the studio ghibli movies will. Prolly not The Grave of the Fireflies tho. My boyfriend said that a sad film. </p>
<h3>Klaus</h3>
<p> A 2D animated movie about a priveleged postman who is stationed in a small town in the north pole and meets a toymaker. The team behind this created new art techniques to bring 2D to a new level and I love how beautiful this movie is, both art and story. This will heal your inner child. 1000/10. </p>
